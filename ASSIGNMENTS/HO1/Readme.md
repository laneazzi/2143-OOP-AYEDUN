**Abstraction:**

The act of displaying only essential information and hiding the details.

**Attributes / Properties:**
 An attribute acts as a note to the compiler that provides additional information 
 about the code for optimization purposes and enforcing certain conditions on it.
 
 **Class:**
 This is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member
 functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 
 
 **Class Variable:**
 Variables that are defined in a class outside of any metod constructor or block. 
 They are declared using the static keyword.

**Composition:**
This is then proccess of using smaller objects to create bigger ones,
or using pre existing classes in a new class.
 
**Encapsulation:**
Binding together data and the functions that use them.

**Friends:**
This is a class that can access private and protected members of
other class in which it is declared as friend.

**Inheritance:**
Using already existing classes as new class types, thus inheriting their structure.

**Instance Variable:**
Non static ariables that are defined in a class outside of any metod constructor or block. 

**Member Variable:**
A member variable is a variable that is associated with a specific object,
and accessible for all its methods.

**Method:**
A member function of a class.

**Multiple Inheritance:**
Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.

**Object:**
An Object is an instance of a Class

**Overloading:**
An overloaded declaration is a declaration that is declared with the same name as a previously declared 
declaration in the same scope, except that both declarations have different arguments and implementation.

**Polymorphism:**
Plymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed
depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

**Public / Private / Protected:**
This are the various access identifiers of a class. Public means accessible outside the class,
Private means members cannot be accessed from outside the class, Protected  members cannot be 
accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. 


**Virtual:**
A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is
re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.
