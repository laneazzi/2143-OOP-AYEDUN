## How to use my 1-bit mini plague.inc (Pandemic Sim)

I am using the SIR model. This program calculates R which is the average number of people infected by a single person during that persons "infectious" stage.

To run this code, Create a new folder on your desktop and dump my resources folder there. Then in your preffered application copy [Simulation.py]() and [Config.json]() then run from Simulation.py. Also, make sure python and pip are installed. 

Simulation Variables can be altered in the config.json file.

## Config.json includes
 * #### width:

 * #### height :

 * #### population_count :

 * #### sprite_height : 

Dont Change

 * #### sprite_speed : 

Movement speed of sprites


## Simulation.py includes
 * #### A simulation Class that runs the whole simulation from objects of all the other classes.
 * #### An SIR model class to change the model images ( SIR_images
 * #### And other functions for our simulation.
